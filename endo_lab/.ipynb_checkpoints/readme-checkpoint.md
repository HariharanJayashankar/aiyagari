The model in the ipynb works without errors. But need to check if the answers are actually correct.

Potential candidates for this:

I am still suspicious of the code (although it seems like its close. The distribution of assets seems like
what one would expect it to be). But in equilibrium the bottom 40% of HH hold 10% of wealth which seems too large. This might also be becuase the markov chain for the shocks is kinda random.
